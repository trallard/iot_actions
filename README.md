## :robot: :snake: About PyPortal and CircuitPython

This code is meant to run on a PyPortal.

An [Adafruit PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) is an WiFi
-enabled microcontroller device featuring a 3" capacitive touchscreen and CircuitPython baked in.

It can be programmed with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), a variant of Python that can be used to program microcontrollers, originally forked from [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython).

## :package: Setup and dependencies

Please note that in addition to the Pyportal you will also need a data + power USB cable. Make sure this is the case as not all the USB cables allow for data transfer.

### Configuring WiFi
 and Adafruit IO

The PyPortal needs to connect to WiFi
 to fetch the time from the internet using Adafruit IO.

First, rename `secrets.py.sample` to `secrets.py`.

#### WiFi

Update `secrets.py` with the SSID and password for your own WiFi
 network.

Set `ssid` and `password` for your network in the `secrets` dictionary in `secrets.py`.

#### Adafruit IO

If you don't have one already, create a new account on [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/).

Set your `aio_username` and `aio_key` in the `secrets` dictionary in `secrets.py`.

**:lock: Tip: make sure not to commit your `secrets.py` file to source control. To avoid this from happening you can add it to your .gitignore file.**

### Libraries

Make sure to follow [this quickstart](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pyportal-titano/circuitpython) to ensure your PyPortal firmware and libraries are up to date.

If you already know what you are doing you can download the latest version of CircuitPython for the PyPortal Titano from [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/pyportal_titano/).

The following libraries, compatible with CircuitPython 5.3 are required to be present in the `lib` directory. [Download the library bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

 - `adafruit_bus_device`
 - `adafruit_bitmap_font`
 - `adafruit_display_text`
 - `neopixel`
 - `adafruit_pyportal`
 - `adafruit_touchscreen`
 - `adafruit_esp32spi`
