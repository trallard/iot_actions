## :robot: :snake: About PyPortal and CircuitPython

This code is meant to run on a PyPortal.

An [Adafruit PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) is an wifi-enabled microcontroller device featuring a 3" capacitive touchscreen and CircuitPython baked in.

It can be programmed with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), a variant of Python that can be used to program microcontrollers, originally forked from [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython).

## :package: Setup and dependencies

Please note that in addition to the Pyportal you will also need a data + power USB cable. Make sure this is the case as not all the USB cables allow for data transfer.

### Configuring Wifi and Adafruit IO

The PyPortal needs to connect to wifi to fetch the time from the internet using Adafruit IO.

First, rename `secrets.py.sample` to `secrets.py`.

#### Wifi

Update `secrets.py` with the SSID and password for your own wifi network.

Set `ssid` and `password` for your network in the `secrets` dictionary in `secrets.py`.

#### Adafruit IO

If you don't have one already, create a new account on [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/).

Set your `aio_username` and `aio_key` in the `secrets` dictionary in `secrets.py`.

**:lock: Tip: make sure not to commit your `secrets.py` file to source control. To avoid this from happening you can add it to your .gitignore file.**

### Libraries

The following libraries, compatible with CircuitPython 4.0.1 are required to be present in the `lib` directory. [Download the library bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
